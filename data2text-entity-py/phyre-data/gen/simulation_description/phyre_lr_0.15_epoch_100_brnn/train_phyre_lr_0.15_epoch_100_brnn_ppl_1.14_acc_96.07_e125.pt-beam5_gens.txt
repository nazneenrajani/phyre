Thus it maintains contact with the purple ramp . As it begins to roll down the ramp , the red ball falls off of the black ramp and pins the green ball in contact with the purple ramp . As it begins to roll down the ramp , the red ball falls off of the black ramp and pins the green ball in place as the large red ball reaches the end of the black ramp and lands on top of it , effectively trapping it and maintaining contact with the purple ramp .
Both green ball and red ball fall down . The green ball hits the red ball . It bounces on top of the long black bar , races down the slope and reaches the extreme right end of the shorter purple bar . The red ball too slides down the slope of the longer bar after the green ball . The red ball hits the green ball when the latter is on the extreme right end of the shorter bar . Both the balls attempt to move down the slope of the shorter purple bar but get stuck in the opening between the two platforms as the opening is slightly lesser the combined diameters of both the balls . As a result of impact with the red ball , the green balls moves towards the right , hits the shorter black bar , bounces on the purple bar at the bottom and slides towards the right .

The green ball than falls off to the right side of the red ball over the black bar onto the purple bar , where the red ball slowly drifts toward the middle of the middle black bar .
Both green ball and red ball fall down . The green ball hits the red ball and races ahead of it to reach the extreme right end of the purple bar . The red ball too slides downwards the slope of the longer bar after the green ball . The red ball hits the green ball when the latter is on the extreme right end of the shorter bar . Both the balls attempt to move down the slope of the shorter purple bar but get stuck in the opening between the two bars as the combined diameter of the two balls is slightly larger than the size of the opening . As a result of impact of the red ball , the green balls moves towards the right , hits the shorter black bar , bounces on the purple bar at the bottom and slides towards the right .
The green ball slides in between the two slanted bars and hits the red ball on the top left . The red ball falls down to the right side of the black platform while the green ball goes over to the left side over the red ball . Both the balls fall through the opening in the V shaped black bars and hit the bottom . The red ball moves towards the left end while the green ball bounces on top of the purple bar on the right , rolls over it and moves over towards the right end while the green ball bounces on top of the purple bar on the right , rolls over it and moves over towards the right end while the green ball bounces on top of the purple bar on the right , rolls over it and moves towards extreme right end .
The red ball falls and knocks the green ball off of its curved black platform and to the left . It rolls leftwards and continues falling until it lands on the purple floor , as the red ball rolls to the right and makes the green ball roll to the right until it rolls off the platform and to the ground . It stays in place when it lands . The red ball remains on the purple ramp first and begins to roll back down to the left , but the large red ball reaches the end of the black ramp and lands on top of it , effectively trapping it and maintaining contact with the purple ramp . As it begins to roll down the ramp , the red ball falls off of the black ramp and pins the green ball in contact with the purple ramp .
The balls drop , and the red ball touches the black ramp first . It begins to slide down as the green ball bumps into the red ball , making the green ball go to the right onto the purple ramp . As the green ball begins to go down the ramp , the red ball lands on top of it , and eventually rolls slightly to the left .
