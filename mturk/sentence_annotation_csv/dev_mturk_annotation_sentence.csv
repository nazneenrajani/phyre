The red ball makes contact with the top right side of the green ball and the red ball rolls to the right and falls off the platform and along the right wall until it quickly reaches the purple bar where it ends up lodged against the right wall. The collision creates a slight spin on the green ball which causes the green ball to slowly roll to the left and fall from the black platform at a much slower rate than the red ball's fall, The green ball lands on the purple bar and rolls to the left.","00015-319"
