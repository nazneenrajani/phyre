The large red ball and medium green ball are near the top left of the area. The red ball is furthest to the left.","The balls drop, with the green ball on the right landing further down the black ramp than the red ball. The green ball rolls off of the black ramp and onto the purple ramp, but as it starts to roll backwards, it is trapped by the red ball rolling off the ramp and landing on it. Thus it maintains contact with the purple ramp.","00011-004"

The long platform is almost 5-6 times longer than the smaller platform and placed diagonally from the left while slanting downwards. The small platform is placed diagonally from the right and slanting downwards. Both green and red balls are hovering above the long platform. The smaller green ball is placed towards the top while the larger red ball is directly below the green ball and positioned very close to the long platform.","The green ball falls on top the the red ball, bounces over it and hits the downward slope of the long platform. It races downwards and hits the upper end of the shorter black platform towards extreme right. As a result of impact of the green ball, the red ball too hits the downward slope of the long platform and moves after the green ball. The red ball hits the green ball when the latter has touched the upper slope of the shorter platform. Both balls attempt to move downwards the slope of the right platform but get stuck in the opening between the two platforms as the opening is slightly lesser the combined diameters of both the balls.","00011-093"
