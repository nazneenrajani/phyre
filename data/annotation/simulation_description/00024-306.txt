The balls fall down, with the grey ball landing on the left side of the opening and the red ball on the right side. Neither one of them falls through the opening. The green ball falls and bounces off of the grey ball, rolling slightly to the left, and bounces off the right ball to slide down the hole and land on the purple floor underneath.
