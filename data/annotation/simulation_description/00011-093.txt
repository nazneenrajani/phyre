The green ball falls on top the the red ball, bounces over it and hits the downward slope of the long platform. It races downwards and hits the upper end of the shorter black platform towards extreme right. As a result of impact of the green ball, the red ball too hits the downward slope of the long platform and moves after the green ball. The red ball hits the green ball when the latter has touched the upper slope of the shorter platform. Both balls attempt to move downwards the slope of the right platform but get stuck in the opening between the two platforms as the opening is slightly lesser the combined diameters of both the balls.
