Both the green ball and red ball fall down. The red ball hits the slanting right black bar while the green ball hits the red ball. Both the balls fall through the opening in the V shaped black bars and hit the bottom. The red ball moves towards the left end while the green ball bounces on top of the purple bar on the right, rolls over it and moves towards extreme right end.
