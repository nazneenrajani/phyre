The balls drop, with the green ball on the right landing further down the black ramp than the red ball. The green ball rolls off of the black ramp and onto the purple ramp, but as it starts to roll backwards, it is trapped by the red ball rolling off the ramp and landing on it. Thus it maintains contact with the purple ramp.
