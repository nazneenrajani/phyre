Both green ball and red ball fall down. The green ball hits the red ball. It bounces on top of the long black bar, races down the slope and reaches the extreme right end of the shorter purple bar. The red ball too slides down the slope of the longer bar after the green ball. The red ball hits the green ball when the latter is on the extreme right end of the shorter bar. Both the balls attempt to move down the slope of the shorter purple bar but get stuck in the opening between the two bars as the combined diameter of the two balls is slightly larger than the size of the opening.
