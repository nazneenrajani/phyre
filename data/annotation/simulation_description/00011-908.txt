The balls roll down the ramp, with the small red one in the lead. It rolls off of the ramp and onto the smaller purple ramp on the opposite side. The green ball follows close behind and lands on top of the red ball, pinning it in place. It rolls slightly to the right, which pushes the red ball to the left and off of the purple platform until it falls on the floor and the green ball remains on the platform.
