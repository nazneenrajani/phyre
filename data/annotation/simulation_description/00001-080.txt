The red ball is dropped. When it hits the blue ball, the red ball rolls to the right while the blue ball starts to roll to the left. The blue ball rolls all the way to the left edge of the platform until it can't go any farther. The red ball rolls towards the right end of the platform, but stops just before getting there.
