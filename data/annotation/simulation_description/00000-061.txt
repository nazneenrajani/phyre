The balls fall, with the tiny red ball hitting the ground first and the blue ball landing on top of it. The blue ball rolls off of the tiny red ball to the left, sending the red ball to the right and it rolls until it hits the end of the area. The blue ball continues rolling left until it hits the green ball.
