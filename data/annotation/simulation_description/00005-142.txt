The red ball falls and lands inside of the grey cup. It's too big so it seals the entrance. The small green ball falls and glances off the red ball, rolling to the left and pushing the red ball (and cup that it's stuck in) to the right. It leans until the red ball touches the left hand side, and the green ball has continued rolling to the left until it landed on the purple floor.
