Gravity takes hold and the tiny red ball begins rolling down the diagonal  black bar. The grey cup falls, lands on the red ball, and rolls with it for a short time before it topples over to the right. It gets stuck in the fulcrum of the two diagonal bars and the green ball rolls out, touching the purple bar. The small red ball is pinned on the other side.
