The balls fall, with the large red ball pressing down the blue bar on the fulcrum to depress it. The green ball lands on the left hand side, which is raised due to the red ball's weight, and it begins to roll towards the red ball. As the red ball rolls off of the blue bar, the bar suddenly shifts the other direction now that the green ball is holding it down, and it rolls back towards the left.
