The green ball falls until it lands on the black platform. The green ball rolls to the right down the black platform. When it reaches the end of the black platform, it falls down and to the right until it contacts the purple bar. The momentum of the green ball carries up the purple bar to the right until it hits the right wall. The green ball then rolls down the purple bar to the left until it hits the red ball and stops, still in contact with the purple bar.
