It then bounces over the red ball, gently touches the end of the left bar and falls through the opening to the ground and lands just to the left of the black platform. The red ball rolls off the bar and falls to land to the left of the blue ball. The blue ball bounces to the right and goes over the black platform, stopping just to the right of it.
