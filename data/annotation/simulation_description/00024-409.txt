As all the balls fall, the red ball hits the black bar first, the gray ball then hits the red ball pushing the red ball slightly to the right and the gray ball moves left on the black bar. The green ball then lands on the gray ball then the red ball almost simultaneously pushing them farther apart and centering the green ball over the gap. The green ball then falls through the gap and lands on the purple bar.
