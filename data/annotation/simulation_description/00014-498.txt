The balls fall, with the red ball on the bottom. The red ball lands on the black split wall of the cubby and the green ball bounces off of the red ball at the same time. The red ball rolls to the left into the cubby, and the green ball rolls to the right. It hits the black wall of the split area and continues rolling left until it reaches the purple.
