The green and gray balls start falling down from the top on opposite sides of the divider and the red ball falls down and starts rolling down the ramp to the right. The red ball and the green ball collide, which sends the green ball through the hole in the vertical divider. The red, green and gray balls all hit the bottom with the green and gray balls hitting the purple bar and the red ball is to the left of the vertical divider.
