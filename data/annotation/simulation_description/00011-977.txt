Both green ball and red ball fall down. The green ball hits the red ball and races ahead of it to reach the extreme right end of the purple bar. The red ball too slides downwards the slope of the long black bar and hits the green ball. Both the balls are unable to slide down as they get stuck in the opening between the two bars.
