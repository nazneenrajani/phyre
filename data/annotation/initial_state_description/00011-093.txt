There are two black platforms. The long platform is almost 5-6 times longer than the smaller platform and placed diagonally from the left while slanting downwards. The small platform is placed diagonally from the right and slanting downwards. Both green and red balls are hovering above the long platform. The smaller green ball is placed towards the top while the larger red ball is directly below the green ball and positioned very close to the long platform.
