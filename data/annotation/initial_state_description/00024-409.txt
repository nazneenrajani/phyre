The purple bar is all the way across the bottom. A black bar is above the purple bar with a gap in the middle that is barely bigger than the green ball. The gray ball is suspended above the black bar, to the left, with its right side hanging over the gap. The red ball is suspended a little lower than the gray ball, to the right, with its left side hanging over the gap. The green ball is suspended at the top above the gap and the other two balls.
