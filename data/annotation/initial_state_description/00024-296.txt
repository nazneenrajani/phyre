There are two black platforms. They are directly beside one another. One is on the left edge and one is on the right edge. There is a small space between the two platforms. The red ball is just above the leftmost end of the right platform. The gray ball is just above the red ball, but lined up with the rightmost edge of the left platform. The blue ball is above the gray ball, but centered with the space between the platforms.
