There is a black line in the middle of the graph with an opening in the middle. There is a purple bar at the bottom. There are three balls: equal-sized red and gray balls, and a smaller green ball. The red ball is almost touching the black bar, the grey ball is touching the red ball, and the green ball is above them.
