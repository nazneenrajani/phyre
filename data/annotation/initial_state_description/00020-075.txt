There are a row of black platforms to the left that are slanted down towards the middle and a black bar vertically down the middle with a hole the size of the grey ball a little more than halfway up. The green ball is hovering at the top between the slanted platform and the bar, the red ball is on the edge of the third platform from the top, and the grey ball is to the right of the bar in the middle parallel to the third platform from the bottom.
