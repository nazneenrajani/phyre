There is a slightly concave black platform, which is slightly longer than the size of the green ball and which is approximately in the middle of the chart on the y-axis and its distance to the right wall is slightly larger than the size of the red ball. There is a green ball resting directly in the center of the black platform. The red ball is approximately four times as large as the green ball and is placed above the green ball and slightly to the right side. The purple bar is at the bottom.
