There are two bars at the top that mimic a funnel. There is a black line for 4/5 of the bottom with a purple bar on the right side. There is a black bar on top of the bottom black bar. There is a large red ball and a small green ball. The green ball is falling down the funnel while the red ball slides on the right side.
