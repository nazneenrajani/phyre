There is a black platform connected to the left wall about two-thirds up. It slopes down to the right and ends three-quarters of way across the bottom at about one-third the height of the walls. Slightly lower than the right end of the black platform is a purple bar connected to the right wall and sloping down to the left about one-fifth the length of the bottom. There is small vertical gap between the black platform and the purple bar. The green ball is poised over the black platform. A larger red ball is placed on the bottom, just to the left of the purple bar.
