There are several ramps in a vertical line that tilt down and to the right. The red ball is above the ramp that is 3 from the top. About the width of 2 gray balls to the right of this there is a vertical divider with a hole in the middle. The purple bar is on the bottom to the right of this divider. At the top, the green ball is to the left of the divider and the gray ball is to the right of it.
